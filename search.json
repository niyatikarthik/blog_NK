    "text": "What happens in our body while doing sports?\nWhen you exercise, more immune cells are made in the white blood cells, which protects against inflammation and pathogens. If the body exerts itself, it is under a kind of stress, like with an illness. Meanwhile, the body reacts as if it were infected by pathogens. Although it is not really affected, the immune cells clean up any foreign particles or non-functioning cells. After exercise, the number of immune cells in the blood decreases again. However, they work better the next time they are needed. When you train, you strengthen your immune system at the same time."
